# Project Title
Louise Kickstarter analysis
A brief description of what this project does and who it's for
The project is for Louise to help her analysis her campaign funding

# Analysis and challenges 
I did my analysis by analyzing the data and finding how different campaigns faired on in relation to their launch data and funding goals 

# Theater outcomes by launch data
The months of May, June and July are the best months for Louise to start her theater campaign. Louise could also capitalize in the month of October since there was no cancelation and there was a pick in successful campaigns.

# Outcome based on goals
Louise had higher chances of a successful campaign if the goals were to be less than $20,000. The lower the goal the higher the success rate. This conclusion can be drowned from the fact that the success rate of goals set less than $20000 was about 50% and when the goal was less going for less than $1000 the success was about 80%

# Limitations 
Even though the data set provided useful information to assist Louise in her campaign, the data was not resent. Resent data set could assist her in unveiling resent trends. 

# Possible graphs and tables. 
Based on the data, different tables could be created to visualize the data better. A graph could be created showing the number of successful goals in each country to help Louise maximize the funds for each country.
